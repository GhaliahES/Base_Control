# Base_Control
Second Taks 

First I like to mention that I fixed the design of my first task (Robot Arm Control)

In this repository I have Done the Following:

1. Designing the interface of the Base Control
2. Created Database for the Base Control in phpmyadmin
3. Connecting the php and control interface with the Database
4. merged the Arm Control and Base Control in one page for the user to choose what to control
5. interfaces mobile web view (had an issue with the Base Control mobile web view, and still trying to know what the problem)
6. attached picture for the Database and all of the three interfaces 

I used in the Task:
1. CSS for designing
2. HTML and PHP pages
3. phpmyadmin for Database
4. Sublime Text for the Coding
5. XAMPP for the Localhost
6. Firefox browser
7. with the help of Youtube, w3schools



The picture for the Database and all of the three interfaces:
